  # In order to control who to notify, the "tag" parameter for the st2.ask action would be
  # used to indicate metadata about this specific instance (would be set in the workflow).
  # Since it's in the parameters, we can get a handle on it here in the rule and use it to
  # inform our decision on who to notify.
  #
  # This is a very static, simple example - and would require one rule for each notification "group"
